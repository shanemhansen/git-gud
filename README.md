# git-gud
git gud with the power of emacs and git

## What is it?

One day I realized git gud could be a real command if it did something with `git` and emacs `Grand Unified Debugger` so I stuck them together.

The End.

## Planned features

If there's something useful that actually leverages git integration to emacs or gud in a useful way I'd accept a PR.
